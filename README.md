# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

**First, I had a look at the instructions and at this readme.  After noticing this was empty I moved onto iteration 1 and read through that.  I ran the rspec on my forked and cloned repo. I had the info match the screenshot, so I continued.  I then identified which class specs had the errors from that total rspec and did each one at a time.  Following the TDD protocol I did one test at a time in each spec file until they all passed.:)**

What was hard about working with code you did not write?
**Since I've spent so much time looking at other people's code to get a gist for what I need to do, I felt comfortable.  It was easy to read and I understood mostly what it was doing.  I'm getting a better grasp of postion/flow in sequence in a class and know where things should be.**

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
**Similiar to what I had said in the previous response I am getting comfortable looking through another code to try to understand what it is doing. Also having done some debugging practice I feel okay examining code.**
